# Where in the world

Where in the world is a frontendmentor challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca

## My Solution

#COMING SOON#

## The challenge

User should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## What I learned

- Styled components (custom components / ThemeProvider / GlobalStyle)
- Dark Mode and light mode toggle
- Transfering the whole app with plain CSS to styled Components
- Basics of React Router
- Saving state to localStorage
- Custom hooks
- React Lazy and suspense to load important components first.

## Continued development

I would like to create these types of projects with more basic git workflow in mind.
The problem I had with this project was that I made huge changes at once. So there is no commit history with clear understanding of what was added and why.

Also I added Styled Components too late so it took time to transfer the whole page from CSS.
